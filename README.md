# Sparkler

Sparkler is a set of tools that helps verifying the correctness of Sparkle appcast feeds served by a service similar to the manuscripts-update appcast server (itself to be open sourced in due course). 

The code is purely Swift and really intended as a quick set of developer tools, so don't expect too much finesse.
